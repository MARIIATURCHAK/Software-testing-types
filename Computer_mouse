1.	Installation Testing
•	Verify that the indicator light is illuminated, confirming a successful connection
•	Verify that the mouse is displayed in the list of connected devices, with its status showing as "Connected"
•	Verify that the necessary drivers are automatically installed or recognized by the operating system
2.	Smoke Testing
•	Verify that the left and right mouse buttons respond to clicks
•	Verify that the cursor moves on the screen.
3.	Functionality Testing 
•	Verify that clicking the left button selects and activates elements, while clicking the right button opens the context menu
•	Verify that a double-click on a mouse button performs the expected action, such as opening a file or program
•	Verify that an object can be successfully moved from its original position to a new location by dragging and dropping it.
•	Verify that a middle-click performs the expected action, such as opening a link in a new tab
•	Verify that the mouse scroll wheel scrolls content up and down
4.	Compatibility Testing 
•	Check the connection of the mouse to different devices (laptop, PC, TV, etc.).
•	Test mouse performance on different surfaces(Desk, Mouse pad, Glass, Fabric, etc.)
•	Check compatibility with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
•	Test functionality with different USB ports (2.0 / 3.0)
•	Verify that the mouse works with USB-C ports using an appropriate adapter (if applicable)
•	Verify that the mouse does not cause compatibility issues with other connected devices
5.	Usability Testing
•	Evaluate how comfortable the mouse is to hold (ergonomics).
•	Check if buttons are easily accessible and logically placed.
•	Test the weight — whether it feels too heavy or too light.
•	Assess comfort during long-term use (over 2 hours).
6.	Security Testing
•	Verify that the wired mouse transmits only standard Human Interface Device signals by using a USB protocol analyzer to monitor and analyze the data packets
7.	Safety Testing
•	Ensure there are no sharp edges or dangerous components.
•	Check that the device does not overheat during long use
•	Verify proper insulation of the mouse's internal wiring
•	Ensure materials used are non-toxic and comply with safety standards
8.	Performance Testing
•	Measure response time between mouse movement and on-screen cursor movement.
•	Test signal stability during active use.
9.	Load Testing
•	Perform 1000–5000 continuous clicks to test button and scroll wheel stability.
•	Check if the device maintains consistent performance under continuous motion.
10.	Stress Testing
•	Test the mouse under extreme conditions:
o	Rapid clicking (5000+ times).
o	Long-term gaming or heavy use sessions.
•	Test protection against environmental factors (dust, moisture, splashes).
11.	UI Testing (User Interface)
•	Verify that button size, shape, and placement are consistent with the design
•	Confirm that any branding or logos are correctly applied
12.	UX Testing (User Experience)
•	Сheck the ease of connecting the mouse
•	Test button placement and accessibility for users with different hand sizes.
•	Verify the quality of the surface material
