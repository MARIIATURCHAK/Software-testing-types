1. Installation / Setup
•	Check connection to the electrical network (voltage, cable, plug).
•	Ensure power indicators work properly (LED or display).
•	Verify correct placement of the refrigerator (leveling, stability).
2. Smoke Testing
•	Verify basic operation after connection:
o	Internal cooling.
o	Operation of power buttons (if present).
o	Opening and closing of doors without issues.
3. Functionality Testing
•	Check for shelves, drawers, and their durability.
•	Verify temperature settings for the fridge and freezer compartments.
•	Test additional functions (if available: clock, door open alert, fast cooling mode).
4. Compatibility Testing
•	Check compatibility with different room sizes (ventilation space around the refrigerator).
•	Test normal use with various types of food.
5. Usability Testing
•	Check ease of opening and closing doors.
•	Verify door open alert works correctly.
•	Test intuitiveness of the control panel and accessibility of buttons/display.
•	Evaluate convenience of shelf and drawer placement for user access.
6. Safety Testing
•	Verify protection against compressor and electrical overheating.
•	Ensure the exterior does not reach unsafe temperatures.
•	Check that doors are safe for children (prevention of finger trapping).
•	Verify absence of sharp edges or hazardous protrusions.
•	Check stability of the refrigerator to prevent tipping.
•	Inspect electrical wiring and plugs for safety (insulation, no damage).
7. Security Testing
•	Test resistance to electromagnetic interference and voltage fluctuations.
•	Check durability of the body and doors under external impact (bumps, falling objects).
•	Ensure door open and temperature alert signals work under extreme conditions.
8. Performance Testing
•	Measure time to reach the set temperature in fridge and freezer compartments.
•	Measure power consumption.
•	Verify correct operation of temperature and alert indicators.
9. Load Testing
•	Repeated door opening and closing (e.g., up to 70,000 cycles) to test durability of mechanisms and alert signal stability.
•	Test operation of shelves and drawers under load with food products.
10. Stress Testing
•	Continuous operation of the refrigerator for 24–48 hours to verify stable cooling.
•	Extreme load conditions: fully stocked fridge to test compressor performance.
•	Excessive door opening beyond normal use (more than 70,000 cycles) to test durability.
11. UI Testing (User Interface)
•	Check readability and clarity of indicators and control settings.
•	Verify visibility and clarity of display or control panel.
•	Test proper operation of buttons, knobs, or touch panels.
•	Check interior lighting (if available).
12. UX Testing (User Experience)
•	Evaluate ease of opening and closing doors.
•	Check overall convenience: access to shelves and drawers, ease of placing/removing food.
•	Verify effectiveness of door open and temperature alerts for the user.
•	Assess general comfort and usability in daily use.
