1. Installation / Setup
•	Check the presence of the lead.
•	Ensure the pencil is intact, without cracks or major defects.
2. Smoke Testing
•	Write a few words or sentences on standard paper.
•	Ensure the pencil writes properly without skipping or breaking.
3. Functionality Testing
•	Check line thickness (thin, medium, thick).
•	Evaluate writing smoothness on different types of paper (plain, notebook, cardboard).
•	Check the ability to sharpen the pencil.
•	Check that the lead is securely fixed in the pencil body and does not fall out during use.
4. Compatibility Testing
•	Verify performance on different types of paper and notebooks.
5. Usability Testing
•	Check the comfort of holding the pencil in hand.
•	Check writing comfort over extended periods (10–30 minutes).
6. Safety Testing
•	Check for absence of sharp edges or hazardous protrusions on the pencil body.
•	Ensure the pencil is safe for children to use.
6a. Security Testing
•	Check pencil body strength — it should not crack under minor impacts.
•	Test resistance to accidental drops from desk height (should not break or split).
•	For painted pencil bodies: check that the paint does not rub off and does not contain toxic materials.
•	Check the stability of the lead inside — it should not crumble during normal use.
7. Performance Testing
•	Check the number of pages that can be written before the lead is fully used.
•	Verify stable writing after repeated sharpening.
8. Load Testing
•	Write a large volume of text (50–100 pages) and verify stable writing.
•	Test writing under continuous pressure with varying force.
9. Stress Testing
•	Test the possibility of breaking the pencil in the middle under excessive force.
•	Verify that the lead does not break after dropping the pencil from a small height.
10. UI Testing
•	Check visibility of the lead (color, markings).
•	Check markings or other indications on the pencil body (hardness).
11. UX Testing
•	Evaluate writing comfort.
•	Assess overall user experience — ease of use and whether it is comfortable for extended writing without hand fatigue.
